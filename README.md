# velena-rs
The Velena connect 4 engine in Rust.

Directly based on https://github.com/rchastain/velena, which is itself an improved implementation of Victor Allis' Victor engine.

This project aims to be a reproduction as close as possible of the original C implementation, with an included binary crate compatible
with the original Lazarus GUI.
